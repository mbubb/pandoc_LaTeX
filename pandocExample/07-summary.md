### Summary

Across all five articles reviewed, a clear and consistent theme emerges: early attachment experiences between infants and their caregivers significantly influence the neurological foundations of emotional regulation. This body of work highlights the convergence of psychoanalytic theory, developmental psychology, and neuroscience, building a comprehensive picture of how caregiving relationships shape brain development and long-term emotional health.

@biagianti2024breastfeeding emphasize the emotional synchrony that occurs during early feeding interactions, framing breastfeeding as a dyadic regulatory process. Their psychoanalytic interpretation positions mutual gratification and attunement as central to the development of emotional self-regulation (ESR). Neurobiologically, these experiences are associated with oxytocin release and limbic system homeostasis, priming the infant's capacity for trust and emotional balance. @kim2015mind further supports this view by demonstrating how secure attachment fosters mentalizing—the ability to understand one’s own and others’ mental states—through neural systems involving oxytocin, affective attunement, and the limbic system.

Complementing these theoretical and developmental perspectives, @dixon2022amygdala provide neuroscientific evidence for how emotional and cognitive processes are integrated in the brain via the interplay between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This interaction supports decision-making and emotional control, processes that are heavily shaped by early attachment patterns. @packard2021infant extend this line of inquiry to the domain of stress physiology, using rodent and translational human models to illustrate how caregiver presence modulates the development of the HPA axis and amygdala reactivity. Their findings underscore the protective role of secure attachment in buffering stress-induced neural dysregulation.

@rogers2022role provide longitudinal evidence linking early attachment styles to adolescent neural activity and emotional control. Their work shows that even a decade after initial attachment assessments, parental presence can mitigate emotional dysregulation in adolescents—further validating the lasting influence of early caregiving on neurobiological systems.

Despite this convergence of findings, limitations remain. Many studies rely on correlational data or animal models, indicating a critical need for more longitudinal, human-based neuroscience research. Nonetheless, these findings have important implications for developmental health. They highlight the value of parenting education, early intervention programs, and policies that support emotionally responsive caregiving environments. Recognizing the foundational role of attachment in brain development and emotional well-being is not only scientifically valid—it is a public health imperative.
