The integration of emotion and cognition is a central process in the development of emotional self-regulation (ESR). @dixon2022amygdala challenge the traditional notion that these systems are distinct or in conflict. Instead, they propose a co-constructive model in which the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) work collaboratively to support adaptive decision-making. This neural partnership is essential in childhood, when early experiences begin shaping an individual’s ability to manage emotional challenges and exercise executive control.

In this framework, the amygdala serves not only as a detector of threat or fear but also as an evaluator of the emotional and motivational value of potential goals. The PFC, in turn, is involved in planning and executing behaviors that align with those goals. The amygdala signals what matters emotionally, while the PFC generates strategies to pursue or regulate those goals[@dixon2022amygdala]. When functioning in tandem, these regions allow for flexible responses to emotionally complex situations—an ability that is foundational to effective ESR.

Functional neuroimaging data cited by the authors demonstrate that the amygdala and PFC are simultaneously engaged during decision-making tasks, especially those involving emotionally salient stimuli. This constant neural dialogue helps individuals navigate conflicting priorities, suppress impulsive reactions, and modify behavior in real time. These regulatory capabilities are significantly shaped by early relational experiences. For example, a caregiving environment that is responsive and emotionally attuned can strengthen the connectivity between these brain regions, enhancing long-term emotional regulation. In contrast, neglectful or chaotic caregiving may lead to dysregulated patterns of interaction between the amygdala and PFC, increasing vulnerability to impulsivity and emotional instability.

While Dixon and Dweck acknowledge the complexity of empirically validating this model, their work offers a compelling neuroscientific foundation for understanding how early attachment relationships become biologically embedded in the brain’s decision-making architecture. It supports the broader thesis that emotion and cognition are not separate spheres but interwoven systems developed through early caregiving and nurtured by consistent emotional support.
