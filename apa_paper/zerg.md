From the very beginning of life, human beings are wired for connection. The way infants bond with their caregivers—how they are held, soothed, responded to, and nurtured—shapes more than just their early emotional world. It also has lasting effects on how their brains develop and how they learn to manage emotions throughout life. This foundational concept is captured in attachment theory, which originated in the work of John Bowlby and was further developed through Mary Ainsworth’s research in the mid-20th century. Attachment theory explains how the emotional relationship between a child and their caregiver serves as the foundation for healthy psychological development.

Closely connected to this is the concept of emotional self-regulation (ESR)—the ability to understand, manage, and appropriately respond to one's emotional experiences. This ability is not innate but learned through repeated, consistent interactions with caregivers, especially in the earliest stages of life. When caregivers are attuned to an infant’s needs—picking them up when they cry, engaging in eye contact, responding with warmth—the child begins to learn that emotional discomfort is manageable, that safety and comfort can be restored. These are the earliest lessons in emotional regulation, and they are carried into adulthood in both behavior and brain structure.

What’s even more compelling is that these interactions are not only emotional but biological. Neuroscience shows that early attachment experiences actively shape the brain. During infancy, the brain is incredibly plastic—meaning it is rapidly developing and highly sensitive to environmental input. The repeated experiences of security or stress that a child has in the first years of life literally shape neural circuits, particularly in areas like the amygdala, which processes fear and emotional salience; the prefrontal cortex, which helps regulate impulses and think through emotions; and systems like the oxytocin pathway and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which influence bonding and stress responses.

In light of this, understanding how infant-caregiver attachment influences the development of emotional regulation is critical—not just for psychologists and neuroscientists, but for parents, educators, clinicians, and policymakers. A growing body of interdisciplinary research is helping to clarify these connections.

This literature review explores how early attachment experiences contribute to the development of emotional regulation and brain function, particularly through their influence on core neurobiological systems such as the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, oxytocin pathways, and the HPA axis. Five peer-reviewed studies offer insight from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, beginning with the emotional and neurochemical dynamics of the earliest caregiving moments.

## Psychoanalytic and Neurobiological Foundations of Attachment

@biagianti2024breastfeeding provide a deeply thoughtful and interdisciplinary look at what happens in the earliest moments between mother and infant—specifically during breastfeeding—and how those moments can shape a child’s lifelong capacity for emotional self-regulation. The authors do not focus on feeding in the nutritional sense, but rather view breastfeeding as a powerful emotional exchange, one they describe as a “dyadic regulatory process.” In other words, both the infant and the caregiver are influencing and regulating one another, emotionally and neurologically, in that shared experience.

Using insights from object relations theory, drive theory, and attachment theory, the authors argue that these first moments of attunement—where the infant’s needs are not only met but responded to warmly and predictably—form the foundation of the child’s internal sense of safety [@biagianti2024breastfeeding]. These experiences help the child learn that emotional discomfort can be tolerated and relieved, especially in the presence of a trusted caregiver. Over time, this leads to the development of emotional resilience and the ability to self-regulate, even in the absence of the caregiver.

@biagianti2024breastfeeding support this claim by pointing to the neurobiological mechanisms involved. During nurturing interactions like skin-to-skin contact and responsive feeding, the hormone oxytocin is released in both the caregiver and the infant. Oxytocin has been shown to promote bonding, reduce stress, and support emotional attunement. This neurochemical activity enhances the development of neural pathways related to emotional regulation and trust, especially in areas like the limbic system, which governs emotional memory and stress responses.

Importantly, the authors suggest that repeated experiences of this kind lead the infant to internalize a deep, felt sense of emotional safety. These infants are more likely to form secure attachments, which research shows are associated with better outcomes across emotional, social, and cognitive domains. By contrast, when this kind of mutual gratification and attunement is lacking—due to neglect, misattunement, or inconsistency—the child may develop insecure attachment patterns and struggle with emotional dysregulation later in life.

While the article is grounded in theoretical models and draws heavily from case-based examples and psychoanalytic perspectives, it makes a compelling case for the importance of interdisciplinary research. The authors explicitly call for more empirical studies that integrate neuroscience with developmental psychology to better understand how these early bonding experiences influence lifelong emotional development.

Though the paper does not provide new experimental data, its strength lies in synthesizing existing theory and highlighting mechanisms that are increasingly supported by research in neurobiology and psychology. It serves as a powerful reminder that what might seem like “ordinary” caregiving behaviors—holding a baby, responding to cries, feeding with warmth and eye contact—are actually laying down the neurological foundation for emotional life.

### Integration of Emotion and Cognition: The Role of the Amygdala and Prefrontal Cortex

The integration of emotion and cognition is a central process in the development of emotional self-regulation (ESR). @dixon2022amygdala challenge the traditional notion that these systems are distinct or in conflict. Instead, they propose a co-constructive model in which the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) work collaboratively to support adaptive decision-making. This neural partnership is essential in childhood, when early experiences begin shaping an individual’s ability to manage emotional challenges and exercise executive control.

In this framework, the amygdala serves not only as a detector of threat or fear but also as an evaluator of the emotional and motivational value of potential goals. The PFC, in turn, is involved in planning and executing behaviors that align with those goals. The amygdala signals what matters emotionally, while the PFC generates strategies to pursue or regulate those goals[@dixon2022amygdala]. When functioning in tandem, these regions allow for flexible responses to emotionally complex situations—an ability that is foundational to effective ESR.

Functional neuroimaging data cited by the authors demonstrate that the amygdala and PFC are simultaneously engaged during decision-making tasks, especially those involving emotionally salient stimuli. This constant neural dialogue helps individuals navigate conflicting priorities, suppress impulsive reactions, and modify behavior in real time. These regulatory capabilities are significantly shaped by early relational experiences. For example, a caregiving environment that is responsive and emotionally attuned can strengthen the connectivity between these brain regions, enhancing long-term emotional regulation. In contrast, neglectful or chaotic caregiving may lead to dysregulated patterns of interaction between the amygdala and PFC, increasing vulnerability to impulsivity and emotional instability.

While Dixon and Dweck acknowledge the complexity of empirically validating this model, their work offers a compelling neuroscientific foundation for understanding how early attachment relationships become biologically embedded in the brain’s decision-making architecture. It supports the broader thesis that emotion and cognition are not separate spheres but interwoven systems developed through early caregiving and nurtured by consistent emotional support.

### Mentalizing and Attachment

Mentalizing—the capacity to understand one’s own and others’ mental states—is a cornerstone of healthy emotional and social development. According to @kim2015mind, mentalizing is not simply a cognitive skill acquired through learning, but a neurodevelopmental capacity that emerges through early attachment relationships. It allows individuals to make sense of behaviors in terms of underlying feelings, thoughts, and intentions, which is essential for empathy, emotional regulation, and social functioning.

Secure attachment between infant and caregiver serves as the primary context in which mentalizing develops[@kim2015mind]. In early infancy, caregivers engage in affective attunement, responding sensitively and consistently to their child’s emotional cues. This nonverbal communication signals to the infant that their internal experiences are recognized and valued. Over time, these interactions help the child develop a coherent understanding of self and other—an internal working model that supports more complex reflective capacities later in life. Securely attached children begin to interpret not only their own emotions but also the mental and emotional experiences of those around them.

From a neurobiological perspective, @kim2015mind highlights the role of oxytocin, the limbic system, and prefrontal cortical regions in supporting the development of mentalizing abilities. Oxytocin, often called the “bonding hormone,” is released during moments of caregiver-child interaction, particularly those involving physical touch and emotional closeness. This hormone enhances trust and social bonding and plays a crucial role in forming and reinforcing attachment relationships. Neural imaging studies show that securely attached individuals display heightened activation in areas such as the medial prefrontal cortex and the temporoparietal junction—regions consistently associated with perspective-taking and emotional understanding.

In contrast, disruptions in early attachment—whether due to neglect, trauma, or inconsistent caregiving—can impair the development of these systems. Such disruptions are linked to deficits in mentalizing, which in turn are associated with various forms of psychopathology, including borderline personality disorder, depression, and anxiety. Without a secure foundation in early life, the capacity to interpret and regulate emotional experiences may be compromised.

While Kim’s (2015) synthesis provides a comprehensive picture of the interplay between neurobiology and attachment, it primarily draws from correlational data and integrates a wide range of sources. This breadth, though informative, limits the ability to establish causal pathways. Nonetheless, the work offers compelling evidence that early attachment experiences fundamentally shape the brain’s capacity for mentalizing and emotional regulation.

Neurobiological Stress Regulation and Attachment
The early caregiver-infant relationship plays a pivotal role in calibrating the brain’s response to stress, especially during the critical developmental window of infancy. @packard2021infant explore how attachment quality directly influences the neurobiological systems responsible for stress regulation—namely, the amygdala and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. These systems coordinate how the body perceives, processes, and reacts to stressors and are among the most sensitive to early relational experiences.

Drawing upon rodent-based research, the authors found that maternal presence during stress-inducing events in early life mitigates stress responses by dampening amygdala reactivity and suppressing cortisol release via the HPA axis. In particular, rat pups separated from their mothers exhibited heightened stress reactivity, while those in proximity to maternal figures showed more regulated hormonal and neural responses. These findings are echoed in emerging human studies, where securely attached infants demonstrate lower baseline cortisol levels and more adaptive stress responses compared to their insecurely attached peers [@packard2021infant].

This biological buffering effect of attachment relationships carries significant implications for emotional development. In secure attachments, caregivers consistently soothe and co-regulate the infant’s emotional states, allowing the stress-response system to develop with an appropriate threshold for reactivity. Conversely, in cases of neglect, trauma, or inconsistent caregiving, the brain adapts by becoming hypervigilant or underreactive to stress—patterns that are strongly associated with emotional dysregulation, anxiety disorders, and difficulties with executive function later in life.

@packard2021infant make a compelling case for attachment as a primary architect of stress neurobiology. However, the generalizability of their conclusions is somewhat constrained by the heavy reliance on animal models. Although rodent studies provide clear insights into brain function and behavior, translating these findings to humans requires caution due to species differences in brain complexity, social structure, and developmental timelines. The authors acknowledge this limitation and emphasize the need for more longitudinal studies in human populations that track early attachment quality alongside neuroendocrine development over time.

Despite these limitations, the study underscores a critical point: early caregiving experiences are not only emotionally significant but also biologically encoded. Secure attachment acts as a buffer against the harmful effects of stress and lays the foundation for emotional self-regulation and mental resilience.

### Long-Term Impacts of Attachment on Adolescent Brain Development

Longitudinal research offers valuable insights into how early attachment experiences shape neurobiological and emotional outcomes well beyond infancy. @rogers2022role conducted a rare decade-long study examining how attachment security assessed in toddlerhood predicted patterns of emotional and brain regulation in adolescence. This investigation tracked participants from around 32 months of age to 13 years, providing compelling evidence that early attachment leaves a lasting imprint on emotional development and neural function.

In the initial phase, children underwent a modified version of the Strange Situation procedure to assess attachment style. A decade later, at approximately age 13, the same participants completed a Go–NoGo task under fMRI scanning. This task, designed to elicit emotional arousal, was performed under two conditions—alone and in the presence of a parent. The fMRI data revealed that adolescents who had been identified as insecurely attached in early childhood exhibited increased dysregulation in brain regions responsible for emotion regulation, particularly the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), when exposed to aversive stimuli.

However, one of the most noteworthy findings was that the presence of a parent significantly reduced neural and behavioral dysregulation, even in teens who had a history of insecure attachment. This suggests that the regulatory role of caregivers continues into adolescence and may offer a buffering effect against emotional dysregulation during developmentally stressful periods [@rogers2022role]. Such evidence reinforces the notion that the impact of attachment is not confined to early childhood but has enduring relevance for brain development and emotional resilience.

While this study’s longitudinal design and use of neuroimaging methods provide strong support for the enduring influence of early attachment, the authors note several limitations. Chief among them is the relatively small sample size and the reliance on a single early measurement of attachment. These factors limit the generalizability and nuanced interpretation of attachment trajectories over time. Nonetheless, the study stands as one of the few empirical examinations linking early relational experiences to adolescent brain function, highlighting the long-term role of caregiving in shaping emotional regulation systems.

### Summary

Across all five articles reviewed, a clear and consistent theme emerges: early attachment experiences between infants and their caregivers significantly influence the neurological foundations of emotional regulation. This body of work highlights the convergence of psychoanalytic theory, developmental psychology, and neuroscience, building a comprehensive picture of how caregiving relationships shape brain development and long-term emotional health.

@biagianti2024breastfeeding emphasize the emotional synchrony that occurs during early feeding interactions, framing breastfeeding as a dyadic regulatory process. Their psychoanalytic interpretation positions mutual gratification and attunement as central to the development of emotional self-regulation (ESR). Neurobiologically, these experiences are associated with oxytocin release and limbic system homeostasis, priming the infant's capacity for trust and emotional balance. @kim2015mind further supports this view by demonstrating how secure attachment fosters mentalizing—the ability to understand one’s own and others’ mental states—through neural systems involving oxytocin, affective attunement, and the limbic system.

Complementing these theoretical and developmental perspectives, @dixon2022amygdala provide neuroscientific evidence for how emotional and cognitive processes are integrated in the brain via the interplay between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This interaction supports decision-making and emotional control, processes that are heavily shaped by early attachment patterns. @packard2021infant extend this line of inquiry to the domain of stress physiology, using rodent and translational human models to illustrate how caregiver presence modulates the development of the HPA axis and amygdala reactivity. Their findings underscore the protective role of secure attachment in buffering stress-induced neural dysregulation.

@rogers2022role provide longitudinal evidence linking early attachment styles to adolescent neural activity and emotional control. Their work shows that even a decade after initial attachment assessments, parental presence can mitigate emotional dysregulation in adolescents—further validating the lasting influence of early caregiving on neurobiological systems.

Despite this convergence of findings, limitations remain. Many studies rely on correlational data or animal models, indicating a critical need for more longitudinal, human-based neuroscience research. Nonetheless, these findings have important implications for developmental health. They highlight the value of parenting education, early intervention programs, and policies that support emotionally responsive caregiving environments. Recognizing the foundational role of attachment in brain development and emotional well-being is not only scientifically valid—it is a public health imperative.
